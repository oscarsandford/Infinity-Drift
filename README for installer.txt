Quick Start:
- open the Infinity Drift Alpha (v.A1.0) application file
- configure the resolution and graphics quality to your choosing (ultra will generally be fine on most systems)
- hit "Play!" to begin the app or "Quit" to exit without saving your changes


Main Menu:
- TIME TRIAL: race against the clock, compare times
- A.I RACE: battle against a bot car, brush up your skills in a dogfight (coming soon!)
- PLAYER RACE: multiplayer mode for the ultimate Infinity Drift experience (coming soon!)
- STORY MODE: innovative storyline that rewards the player with cars and stats through quests (coming soon!)

=> to get started, click TIME TRIAL, select a car with your arrow keys, and click "GO!"


About the cars (*):
- "AE86" (agile, low-medium power, naturally aspirated)
- "FC3S" (smooth, medium power, turbo)
- "FD3S" (smooth, medium-high power, turbo)
- "WRX" (stable, medium-high power, turbo)
- "GTR" (aggressive, high power, turbo)
- "GT86" (agile, medium power, naturally aspirated)

(*) - I have referred to each vehicle as the real-world sports car they resemble most.
        In future updates and for public release, the cars will be debadged and not labeled in any way.
	Also note that the cars require the player to shift manually using the controls, and are NOT automatic.


About the map:
- I've provided one of the more technical, yet fun tracks that I have worked on
- everything is VERY work in progress and rough in these stages
- follow the road to the very end, your timer will turn from yellow to red and stop once you cross the finish
- the finish point is NOT obvious, but it is just before the course ends, so keep following the road


Controls (looking into wheel support in the future, keyboard for now):
W - accelerator
S - brake
A - turn left
D - turn right
LeftShift - shift up a gear
LeftCtrl - shift down a gear
Space - handbrake
C - toggle camera between 3rd person and dynamic view (**)
Esc - pause menu
R - reset current level
Q - disables headlights when held down

(**) - I've made some cars have their second camera in the driver's seat and some on the hood of the car.
         Let me know which one you prefer.


Known Bugs:
- menu music does not loop
- engine noise from GT86 in menu model
- sometimes time stays stopped if you use the pause menu in a weird way, just hit Esc to fix this
